# API Introduction

## What is an API?

API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface.

API is an interface which enables interactions between different systems. Using API, you can interact with other services and products without knowing how to operate them. API is sometimes regarded as a "contract", which represents the agreement between each side: if one side sends a request, the agreement stipulates how another side will respond.
